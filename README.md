# Cyberspace Security Innovation and Entrepreneurship Practice Course

山东大学网络空间安全学院（研究院）2022年网络空间安全创新创业实践课程相关project

## SM3：

✅**Project 1: implement the naïve birthday attack of reduced SM3**

✅**Project 2: implement the Rho method of reduced SM3**

✅**Project 3: implement length extension attack for SM3, SHA256, etc.**

✅**Project 4: do your best to optimize SM3 implementation (software)**


**Project 5: Impl Merkle Tree following RFC6962**

Project 6: Try to Implement this scheme

## SM2：

✅**Project 7: report on the application of this deduce technique in Ethereum with ECDSA**

✅**Project 8: impl sm2 with RFC6979**

✅**Project 9: verify the above pitfalls with proof-of-concept code**

Project 10: Implement the above ECMH scheme

✅**Project 11: Implement a PGP scheme with SM2**

✅**Project 12: implement sm2 2P sign with real network communication**   

✅**Project 13: implement sm2 2P decrypt with real network communication**

✅**Project 14: PoC impl of the scheme, or do implement analysis by Google**




## Bitcoin-public：

Project 15: send a tx on Bitcoin testnet, and parse the tx data down to every bit, better write script yourself

✅**Project 16: forge a signature to pretend that you are Satoshi**

## Eth-public：

Project 17: research report on MPT

## Real-world-cryptanalysies：

Project 18: Find a key with hash value “\*sdu_cst_20220610\*” under a message composed of \*your name\* followed by \*your student ID\*. For example, “\*San Zhan 202000460001\*”

✅**Project 19: Find a 64-byte message under some k fulfilling that their hash value is symmetrical**


## Real-world-ZK：

Project 20: Write a circuit to prove that your CET6 grade is larger than 425. 

a.Your grade info is like (cn_id, grade, year, sig_by_moe). These grades are published as commitments onchain by MoE. 

b.When you got an interview from an employer, you can prove to them that you have passed the exam without letting them know the exact grade. 

The commitment scheme used by MoE is SHA256-based. 

a. commit = SHA256(cn_id, grade, year, sig_by_moe, r)
